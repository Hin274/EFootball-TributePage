      <h2>Why do I like this game?</h2>
      <p>I have played both FIFA and PES(before rebranded to EFootball) between 2007 to 2014 however, I was more fond of playing PES as I felt more engaged due to the football simulation being very close to the sport in reality regardless of the lack of licenses compared to FIFA.

      <h3>Free game</h3>
      <p>Efootball 2022 is a free game on any system whereas before it was a paid game all be it this series is slightly limited game modes due to it being a new adventure for Konami where they have made a decision that any other game modes such as the popular Master League will be a downloadable paid content.</p>
      <h3>Great rewards and free items</h3>
      <p>I think Konami are very generous with this aspect. They reward their users with free items such as in game currency, coins or even a free player just by logging in to the game daily or if the game was down for maintenance for updates. </p>
      <h3>Simplified tactics</h3>
      <p>They offer the template for each style of play for you to choose from, so you could just quickly pick your style and get into a game. Therefore you don't have to go into much depth tweaking each individiual setting, wasting a lot of time setting up your team.</p>
      <h3>You can check out EFootball 2022 from the official Konami website <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.konami.com/efootball/en/" target="blank">here</a></h3>
